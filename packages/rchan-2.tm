# rchan 1.0
#
# It's basically a FIFO channel. Whatever you put into it is what you get out.
#
# I'm using it to experiment with refchan's right now..

# But this, or something like it, will be used in Tcldrop as a way 
# for the bot interps to communicate with the master interp.
#
# And I think similar code can be used for inter-bot communication.. 
# (basically fake sockets between multiple bots running in our process)
#
# Note, this is based on the incomplete and buggy code at http://wiki.tcl.tk/17594
